                        <p>The overwhelming amount of multimedia input needs aggressive filtering and conscious consumption to not let it numb and distract our senses from what actually matters.
                            After using Facebook, Mastodon, Xing and Twitter for several years I drew the conclusion that it is an utter waste of time.
                            And did I already mention how much I hate advertisement?
                            Nearly everybody should be aware of the privacy issues by now, too.
                            So I quit.
                            I do not want to voluntarily shovel money into the pockets of people who are harvesting my data.
                            Years spent with such kind of social networks yielded the realization of their full expendability once I left them.</p>
